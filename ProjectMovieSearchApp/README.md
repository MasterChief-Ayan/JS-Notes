# **Review**

For a first JavaScript project, I would rate this code around **75/100**. Here's why:  

### **Strengths (+)**:
- ‚úÖ Basic functionality of searching movies and adding to favorites is working.  
- ‚úÖ Good use of `fetch` for API calls.  
- ‚úÖ Usage of `localStorage` for saving favorite movies.  
- ‚úÖ Error handling with `try...catch` and `.catch`.  

### **Areas to Improve (-)**:
- ‚ùå **Variable Naming:** `imbdID` should be corrected to `imdbID`.  
- ‚ùå **Code Duplication:** Repeated code for creating movie cards in both search and favorite sections. Consider making a reusable function.  
- ‚ùå **API Key Exposure:** The API key is directly in the code. Consider keeping it secure.  
- ‚ùå **Error Handling:** The error handling could be more informative to the user instead of just logging to the console.  
- ‚ùå **HTTPS Usage:** Use `https` instead of `http` for better security.  

### **Improvements for Higher Score:**
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions.  
- Implement better error messages.  
- Use modern JavaScript practices like `const` and `let` consistently.  

**Final Thoughts:** Excellent effort for a first project! Keep improving and refining. üöÄ
